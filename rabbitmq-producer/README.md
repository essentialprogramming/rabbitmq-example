# Microservice Reference Project

This project is inspired by the idea to quickly create a production ready project with all the required infrastructure at low cost yet with important security measures in place and ability to quickly scale in order to ship a quality product to early adopters. Ideal for quickly starting an app to validate ideas and scale if needed. The implementation includes code samples for different features. It uses Spring as the framework of choice because it provides a nice set of convenience features when bootstrapping and plugging together the application.
